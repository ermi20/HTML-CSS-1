The division of labor between HTML and CSS
• Introduction to HTML:
    • Parents, children, attributes

      div p <a id="help" class="links" name="Help" href="help.html">help</a>

    • Indentation

      <body>
        <header>
        </header>

    • Semantic elements

      <main>
      <header>
      <footer>
      <article>
      <section>
      <aside>

    • Paragraphs, links, images, lists

      <p>, <a>, <img>, <ul><li></li></ul>, <ol>

• Introduction to CSS:
    • Where can we write it and what difference does that make?

      inline
      in <style> tag
      in seperate file

    • Selectors (id, class, element type), properties

      #main, .article, div, [name="abstract"]
      look at descendent selectors page

Recap HTML
    • Basic HTML structure

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>
        <meta>
        <style>
      <body>

Responsive web development
    • Relative measurements (%, (r)em, vw)

      %, em (relative to current font size), rem (relative to root font size), vw, vh

    • Media queries

    @media screen {

        body { font: 12px arial, sans-serif }
        #nav { display: block }
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: 1000px) {

        #content { width: 100% }
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {

         #nav { float: none }

    }

    @media screen and (orientation: landscape) {

         #nav { float: left }
    }

    • Positioning (absolute, relative, fixed)

    Sample Positions page; older page
    consider fixed; left, right set to 0; width 100%

    • Floating and clearing

ARIA

Is the CSS Zen Garden fully accessible?
Probably not. The markup is as semantic as possible and WAI-ARIA roles have been added where

appropriate. The “A11y” link on the main Zen Garden page even used to point to automated tests

that checked the Zen Garden’s markup for AAA/Section 508 compliance. It passed, but these

validators are no longer available.

But even with those measures, accessibility was not necessarily achieved. The WCAG guidelines

contain multiple checkpoints which can not be tested automatically; they require a judgment

call made by a human, not software. Many designs use techniques (hiding text from the browser,

fonts sized with the px unit) which are by nature inaccessible, so the CSS of any particular

design is as relevant as the markup when it comes to accessibility.

In some cases and with certain designs, the Zen Garden may come close to achieving AAA

compliance. But we can’t in good conscience say that the Zen Garden is a fully accessible

site, since we now need such a long disclaimer.
